# 0. Rotate 2D Matrix

This project focuses on rotating a given \(n \times n\) matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place. The task is to implement an algorithm that performs this rotation without using additional space (other than modifying the matrix itself).

## Problem Statement

Write a function that rotates an \(n \times n\) 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The function should modify the matrix in-place, and it should not return anything.

### Prototype
```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    """Rotates the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place."""
